This is a just study about discord bots with discord.js lib. You're gonna find simples commands. 
To differentiate from the tutorials I made the command !make (allows you to create a command that calls for a image).
So... Take a look, feed the bot in a particular server.

## Warnings
It's a simple bot for a simple study, I don't made cooldown or take security measures for a real and huge server, proceed at your own risk
